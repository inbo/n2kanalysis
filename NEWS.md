# `n2kanalysis` 0.3.0

## Breaking changes

* Add [`checklist`](https://inbo.github.io/checklist/) infrastructure.
  This required renaming some function names and arguments in order to comply
  with the style guide.

## Other changes

* Suggest `INLA` instead of importing it to make `n2kanalysis` build on
  [R-universe](https://inbo.r-universe.dev).
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
